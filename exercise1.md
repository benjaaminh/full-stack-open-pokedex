In Java, linting tools such as Checkstyle and PMD can be used. Both linting tools can be used to scan the code and list the problems. For unit testing, JUnit can be used. For integration testing, Spring test is a good framework. For mocking in unit tests, Mockito can for instance be used. For test automation of web-applications, Selenium can be used. The most common build tools for Java are Maven and Gradle. 
Some alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions are Spacelift, GitLab CI or Azure DevOps.  Spacelift is similar to Jenkins in the sense that it is a self-hosted CI setup. If the development team is using GitLab to host their repositories, GitLab CI can easily be used, since it runs the pipelines directly alongside the GitLab repositories. 
For using Java with these tools, it depends on how large the software will be. If the software is very large and developed by many developers in a large company, we can use a self-hosted environment such as Jenkins. If it is a small project by a couple of developers, GitHub Actions is a better choice. If the application needs stronger security, self-hosting may be a better choice, since the secrets are never exposed to outsiders.
